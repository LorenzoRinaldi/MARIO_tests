   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Terminology
=================================
In the lack of consistent terminology for IO systems in the
scientific community, MARIO uses its own customized variable names. MARIO follows
a thermodynamic way of nomencluture which:

* Uppercase letters represents Flows
* Lowercase lettters represents Coefficients

Following table represents the variables and their explnations in MARIO:
