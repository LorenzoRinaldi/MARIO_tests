    "Any custom MARIO-readable IOT must follow these rules:\n",
    "- It must be in .xlsx format\n",
    "- It must have two sheets. The first must contain the table, the second must be named \"units\" and contains the info on units of measure\n",

    "The structure is the same for both IOTs and SUTs with the difference SUTs must differenciate between activities and commodities, while IOTs just needs sectors. \n",
    "You will notice:\n",
    "- There must be 3 level of indices on both rows and columns\n",
    "- The first level is always the name of the region, apart from those table sets not defined on regions, such as \"Factor of production\" and \"Satellite account\". For these two sets, just provide \"-\".\n",
    "- The second level is always the name of the set (i.e. \"Activity\", \"Commodity\", \"Consumption category\", \"Factor of production\", \"Satellite account\"). In case of an IOT, provide \"Sector\" instead of \"Activity\" and \"Commodity\"\n",
    "- The third level is a label, referring to the name of the item\n",
    "- There must not be blank cells within the matrices \n",
    "There are no particular rules for the order of the labels and sets, MARIO will always sort all the indices in alphabetical order before doing any calculation.\n",
